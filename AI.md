ChatGPT used for the increment A-BetterGui
Helped me with css, making the error bubble to work when an
error message is displayed. Overall it was hard for chat to give
me a solid solution at the start due to it not knowing fully how 
my project worked. Took many prompts and little tweaks in the code
until i got it to work. Chat help me in MainWindow.handleUserInput().
Used chatGPT to help me create helper functions for my parseGui method 
to make it from a super long function to a much shorter one.
